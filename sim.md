## Analysis

### Successful Tests:
1. **Landing Page** - The app correctly loads the Casting Call as the landing page
2. **Role Selection** - The Rising Star role can be selected

### Failed Tests:
1. **Continuation Code** - The code is not being displayed or captured after role selection
2. **Tutorial** - The test cannot find or complete the tutorial/how-to-play screens
3. **Exercises** - The typing exercises are not being found or completed
4. **Navigation** - Manual exercise navigation wasn't tested due to earlier failures
5. **Code Restoration** - Cannot test without a continuation code

### Potential Issues:
- The continuation code popup might not be appearing after role selection
- The tutorial flow might be different than expected
- The exercise text might be rendered in a way that's hard to detect
- Timing issues - the test might be moving too fast

### Recommendations:
1. Add longer wait times between actions
2. Implement better detection for tutorial screens
3. Use more robust selectors for finding exercise text
4. Add debugging screenshots at each major step
5. Consider using Playwright's built-in debugging tools
