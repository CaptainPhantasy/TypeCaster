# TypeCasting - New UX Flow with Continuation Codes 🎭

## Overview
The TypeCasting app now implements a consistent landing page experience where ALL users start at the Casting Call, with the ability to enter a continuation code to restore their progress.

## Key Changes Implemented:

### 1. **Always Show Casting Call First** ✅
- Removed automatic localStorage restoration
- All users (new and returning) see Casting Call on app load
- Clean, consistent experience for everyone

### 2. **Continuation Code System** ✅
```javascript
// Code Format: ROLE-TIME-RAND
// Example: CONF-5847-X9B3
```

### 3. **New User Flow:**
1. **Landing Page** → Casting Call (always)
2. **Code Entry Option** → "Have a continuation code? Enter it here →"
3. **Role Selection** → Choose from 3 theatrical personas
4. **Code Generation** → Automatic continuation code displayed
5. **Tutorial** → Beautiful overlay with instructions
6. **Typing Exercises** → Progressive difficulty

### 4. **Returning User Flow:**
1. **Landing Page** → Casting Call (always)
2. **Enter Code** → Click link to show code entry
3. **Input Code** → Enter their continuation code
4. **Restore Progress** → Jump back to their saved state

## Features Added:

## Code Structure:
```
ROLE-TIME-RAND
│    │    │

└───────────── First 4 letters of role
```
